# Adidas-Sales-Dashboard
In this repo, we have an excel based dashboard designed for the Adidas sales in USA for the years 2020 and 2021.

The dynamic charts show the total sales in US$ for the two years, sales by region, by sales method, as well as the sales by retailers. Included also is a slicer menu to slice the data by years, product, and or region.

I have used pivot tables and charts to develop the dynamic dashbord.
